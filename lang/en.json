    "hlp_ms2": "**🤖 Tutorial: Creating and Configuring Your Bot**\n\n### 1️⃣ **Create a bot with BotFather**\n1. **Open Telegram** and search for `@BotFather`.\n2. **Start a conversation** and send the command `/newbot`.\n3. **Follow the instructions** by choosing a name and a unique identifier for your bot (ending in `bot`).\n4. Once completed, **BotFather will send you a message containing the API token**.\n\n### 2️⃣ **Transfer the message here**\n📩 **Send us the message containing the token**, and we will set up your bot automatically.\n\n⚙️ **Management and Settings**\n➡️ Go to the **Settings** section to manage all your connected bots.\n\n🚀 **Your bot is now ready to be used!**",    
    "hlp_ms3": "**🎉 Help 3: Add Buttons and Likes**\n\n### **1️⃣ Add Buttons to Your Posts**\n\nYou can add multiple buttons on the same line by separating them with a space. If you want to start a new line of buttons, use the symbol `|`.\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClick here (https://example.com) More info (https://anotherexample.com) | Subscribe (https://subscribe.com)\n```\n\nIn this example, you have:\n1. Two buttons on the first line:\n   - Click here redirects to `https://example.com`.\n   - More info redirects to `https://anotherexample.com`.\n2. One button on the second line:\n   - Subscribe redirects to `https://subscribe.com`.\n\nThe `|` symbol creates a new line of buttons. You can add as many buttons as you want on a line, as long as they are separated by a space.\n\n### **2️⃣ Add Likes with Emojis**\n\nSimilarly, you can add up to 5 like emojis on the same line by separating them with a space. To start a new line of emojis, also use the `|` symbol.\n\n**Example**:\n```\n😊 😍 | 😂 😎\n```\n\nIn this example, you have:\n1. Two emojis on the first line:\n   - `😊`, `😍`.\n2. Two emojis on the second line:\n   - `😂` and `😎`.\n\nThe `|` symbol separates the emoji lines, and you can add as many emojis as you want per line (up to a maximum of 5 emojis per line).\n\n### **📌 Summary**\n\n- **Buttons**: You can chain multiple buttons on the same line, separated by a space. For a new line, use `|`.\n- **Likes**: Add as many emojis as you want on the same line, up to 5. For a new line, use `|`.\n\nThis way, you can easily customize your posts with interactive buttons and likes! 🎯",
